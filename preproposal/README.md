# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
For the final project, my partner and I are interested in creating an application, most likely a website, that
will provide eligible voters the necessary information they need in order to vote. This information will most
likely include the voter registration process, registering for absentee ballots, specific home state deadlines,
and more. The purpose is to inform and encourage eligible voters to vote by making all the necessary information
accessible and easy to understand. This application will hopefully be geared towards voters on campus, and will help
find solutions for those encountering trouble getting absentee ballots, etc.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Kevin Quach, section leader: Jo-Jo

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope!
