# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Go Vote!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that gathers information from a user and displays the pertinent information on how to vote in their area.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will ideally be able to be used as a resource for the most up-to-date and accurate voter information. This includes
how to register, where to vote, and perhaps even who to vote for based on political preferences. We are hoping to implement many
features of bootstrap, and also perhaps hope to include locating capabilities.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will be able to collect and process a user's data, and give them an output of at least a basic rundown of how they can vote
in their area.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Hopefully, we will be able to implement a feature that allows for more nuanced analysis of the data they input, such as their
political affiliation, to offer good candidates to back.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this project involves being able to tell where a user is as soon as they open the site, and then redirecting
them to a page specialized for their area automatically. Also, having it be incredibly visually appealing would be a nice plus.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our main next steps involve furthering our comfort with the tools we have just been introduced to in terms of web programming. This
includes HTML, Python, CSS, and by relation, Bootstrap. Additionally, we will have to dive pretty deep into voting trends and
regulations in each state, which will definitely be a time-consuming yet interesting endeavor. Kevin and I will both be involved with all
aspects of the project, dividing the work equally.
